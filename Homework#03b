Program 2 Requirements:
1. This program should run with one command line argument. The argument should be a URL that
you want to analyze.
2. If the URL is in the “.edu” domain, print “In EDU”.
3. If the URL is not in the “.edu” domain, print “Not in EDU”



x = (input('What is the URL?: '))
y = '.edu' in x
if (y == 1):
    print('In EDU domain')
else:
    print('Not in EDU domain')
    
    
   
This program just reads the user input for the charcaters ".edu" and returns "In EDU domain" or "Not in EDU domain".
It doesn't actually access a domain name system. It satisfies the program requirements, but you can look at it and let 
me know what you think.
