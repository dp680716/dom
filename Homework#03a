Program 1 Requirements:
1. This program should run interactively meaning that you should prompt the user for the input at
runtime.
2. Prompt the user for a file size. The user should be able to enter a size in Megabytes or
Gigabytes. They can distinguish this by adding a “M” or a “G” to the end of the size number.
a. Examples
i. User input: 25M means 25 Megabytes
ii. User input: 25G means 25 Gigabytes
3. Prompt the user for a network speed in Megabits/second.
4. Calculate the estimated file transfer time in seconds based on the user input.
a. For times longer than a minute, display the transfer time in minutes and seconds.
b. Remember that you will need to convert the file size to do a correct calculation.
c. Extra Credit: Allow the user to enter the number of decimal places they would like the
transfer time rounded to and format the output accordingly.




# My code for program 1 #


# Prompt user for file Size #

File_size = str(input('What size is the file?: '))
print('The file size is: ', File_size)

# Prompt user for network speed #

Network_speed = str(input('What is your network speed?: '))
print('Your network speed is: ', Network_speed)

# Calculate estimated file transfer time #

Download = File_size/Netowrk_speed
print('Estimated download time', Download)




This is where i'm having trouble. I'm trying to just divide the file size by the network speed, but the user needs to be
able to enter an 'M' or 'G' after the file size to indicate megabytes or gigabytes. Same thing for the network speed with m/s.
so the program fails because of the alphabetical characters I think, but I don't know how to make the program only divide the
numeric value
